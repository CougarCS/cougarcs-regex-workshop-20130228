 * _What is a regular expression?_
 *
 * A regular expression (commonly abbreviated as regex,regexp,etc.)
 * is a "formula" that match to a given text. They use a special
 * notation in order to shorten the meaning. They are used in many
 * programs for finding text and tokenizing/parsing text.
 *
 * Many programming languages give support for regular expressions.
 * They are either built in to the language (e.g. Java, Perl) or are
 * available through libraries.
 *
 * _Java Regex Classes_
 *
 * The main classes that are used for regexes are located in
 * java.util.regex :
 *
 * java.util.regex.Pattern
 * 	turn a regular expression into an object
 * 	(does not have any public constructors)
 * 	class factory method: Pattern.compile()
 *
 * java.util.regex.Matcher
 * 	performs various methods on text using
 * 	the pattern
 * 	(obtained through java.util.regex.Pattern)
